Data Mining project

1st flow:

- Using Resource I, train an ML model
- Use the ML model to predict classes of Resource II
- Compare the actual classes of Resource II with predicted values

2nd flow:

- Using Resource II, train an ML model
- Use the ML model to predict classes of Resource III
- Compare the actual classes of Resource III with predicted values

3rd flow:

- Using Resource I, train an ML model
- Use the ML model to predict classes of Resource III
- Compare the actual classes of Resource III with predicted values

All flows will have the ability to enter text to get a prediction from the ML model
