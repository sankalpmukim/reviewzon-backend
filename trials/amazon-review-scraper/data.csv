"Just go for it!","First of all I would like to tell you that i won't be giving a very technical review like those on ytube videos. I am gonna give a very honest review as a general phone user just like all of you only. This is my first phone for a price above 20k so i thought and researched a lot before buying. I was confused between buying iphone 12 and Nord 2 I know the price difference is more but still I won't go for above 50k to buy any phone other than Iphone. But honestly man i think at 30k this 1+ nord 2 is really astonishing. You don't need to go for one plus 9 or other higher range phones of one plus or else if you have some extra bucks in pocket which u just wanna spend. So I will be telling u the pros and cons of this phone very honestly after 3-4 days of very vigorous usage. Pros: 1. Very ultra premium features at this price range of 30k and pretty much matching features with higer range one plus models. 2. The display is just great. 3. Screen refresh rate you can actually feel to be fast @90Hz. 4. No heating issue in phone or the charger till now. 5. They are giving a back cover with the phone, which is pretty good actually with bumps in side and camera portion which actually saved my phone from a direct fall on a rough floor that too on screen side..and no scratches at all!!..so the cover's tested guys😂and it actually feels elegant. So you need not do the hectic work of searching for back covers after buying a phone and infact the scratch guard which they have put on the screen is quite handy.. I don't think u need to put a temper guard if u handle ur phone well, anyways thats your choice..for me i m gonna go with the scratch guard for some weeks or may be month n lets see how it goes..for now about a week it feels to be performing just outstanding. So i wont be telling u more features of this phone as u can read'em anywhere in its specifications. I will tell you some 'X-Factors of Nord 2. And why you should decide to buy this phone 1. The charging time.. I was like whtt!! When the phone shootes up from 0% to 85% in just about 30mins and upto 100% in around 40-45 mins...So the warp charging is just out of world @65W charger. Never ever saw this in any phone. 2. The stereo speakers. When i played the first song i was just shocked what i just heard. Yes it actually feels to be giving a 3D feel of sound. Actually sound comes out of speakers on bottom right as well as speakers on top of screen which are meant to be for calling purpose only in other phones .So this phone just rocked here. 3. The camera just performs outstanding in low light, dark or even very dark sorroundings. To check it I went on to my terrace and clicked a picture in dark which you can see yourself..i have put it here. 4. The phone buid really feels premium. Some of the cons or I won't say cons..bcz I don't really feel them as cons.as u can ignore them over the astonishing features of this phone..but since we can't go away without mentioning some cons so here are some. 1. They could have provided a little higher battery capacity like those in Samsung phones coz of Such a high resolution display and refresh rate..but it could have increased the weight of phone..so its pretty much understandable. Battery back up is some what 12-14 hrs which I got on continuous usage..like songs.. attending meetings on teams.. Netflix etc. But since it gives so..so..so.. fast charging u just wont feel it. 2. No earphone jack..If that is a con to u..not for me actually😂 Nothing else serious issue this phone has got me into till now .So that it guys..If i find anything else after prolonged Usage I will honestly put it here. So I will say if you wanna buy a phone above 50k just dont..buy this if you budget is ~25k stretch it a lill and buy this Nord 2.","28 Jul 2021","Colour: Gray Sierra Size name: 8GB RAM+128GB Storage","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/5197ODYkaKL._SY88.jpg

"Initial thoughts- A good, practical phone","Received my unit 4hr ago and here is what I think- 1. Feels sturdy and premium in hand. 2. 90hz looks absolutely fine, you won't miss 120hz 3. In normal usage, the phone did not heat. 4. Charged from 20-100% in just 15-20mins. My mind was blow away. 5. Cameras- I didn't use it much but a sample image is attached which I took from the primary rear camera. So far it looks good to me. 6. UI is clean but there were a lot of permissions which I had to accept to use the basic things like camera, search in the drawer. It clearly says in the policy that it shares my data. I believe we cannot do much about this. This is my initial impression, will update accordingly in the future.","28 Jul 2021","Colour: Gray Sierra Size name: 8GB RAM+128GB Storage","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1y0pmNDBSS._SY88.jpg","Yes","Harsimran","4.0","OnePlus Nord 2 5G (Gray Sierra, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Sierra-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B097RDVDL2/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Wait for updates to feel good about purchase.","7/28: Received this yesterday and first impression from look and feel was great. Was waiting for some reviews but will go first on this one, havent tried camera yet and should not as I moved from a Pixel 5 to this one. Purely for sake of google not providing dual apps even with eSim option. Things went south 1) The mobile heated up a bit even during data transfer done via One plus switch App. 2) VLC, gallery kept crashing. Videos will stop in middle and close, gallery will crash while you scroll on pictures. 3) Few things are hard to find, not sure why camera need so many permission just to let you open it. 4) Then came a update today morning and it hit the app cloner seems. Even with FB, Insta and WA on mobile, its not able to see it. I even reinstalled those to see if it picks it up. Seems like a half baked product with lack of testing rolled out to market. We are the test users. Product is overall okay and not my first one plus device. Just a bit of let down to start with and will have to wait on how soon these issues are sorted. Update 7/31: ----------------- - App cloner is showing apps now. However below apps continue to crash - Camera - whatsapp - youtuebe - Spotify - shuttle .  Ruined Android auto as well. I am sure list is long, but these are ones tried today and it's pathetic.","28 Jul 2021","Colour: Blue Haze Size name: 8GB RAM+128GB Storage","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510coKzjoyL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Manny","1.0","OnePlus Nord 2 5G (Gray Sierra, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Sierra-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B097RDVDL2/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Phone not upto expectation as described, Bugs needs to be fixed","I got OnePlus Nord 2 5G phone delivered yesterday. While setting up Phone got an update and updated my phone. Some bugs needs to be fixed by OnePlus team. Below are some findings. 1. Charging time of this phone from 21% to 100% took  auround 16 minutes which is good but at the same time battery is draining too fast after 2 hours battery was 31%. As I am not heavy user of this phone but still battery drained fast. 2. While installing apps or updating apps I get error message stating that my storage is full and need to remove unused apps. I purchased 256 gb internal storage and had 217 gb free storage. 3. While I was using flipkart app I noticed that after 12 seconds app closes automatically and I need to reopen again and again after every 12 seconds. This is very annoying. Please think before you buy this phone.","29 Jul 2021","Colour: Gray Sierra Size name: 12GB RAM+256GB Storage","","Yes","Ratnakaram","1.0","OnePlus Nord 2 5G (Gray Sierra, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Sierra-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B097RDVDL2/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"OnePlus Nord 2 is not worthy for 30k. Poor Display and Camera Quality","Hi All. I have purchased OP Nord 2 for upgrade from my two years old Realme X. But my experience with Nord 2 is very bad. first its display is very bad quality compare to smartphone at 30k range. Even my Realme x display looking good against Nord 2. Its major highlight camera also very poor quality nowhere near to flagship sensor as OP advertising. Daylight pics are pathetic. After system update App Clone function is not working not able to use my 2nd whats app account. Call Recording function is not working which is my main requirement that is working flawless in my realme x. I think OnePlus make fool of us. Everyone who is purchasing will regret afterwards. So beware of OP Nord 2.","28 Jul 2021","Colour: Gray Sierra Size name: 8GB RAM+128GB Storage","","Yes","Tech_one","2.0","OnePlus Nord 2 5G (Gray Sierra, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Sierra-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B097RDVDL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Bugs in software, important functionality not working","Nord 2 software is full of bugs. Clone app is not working after the last update. The ones who had installed lost their data. Fix is expected in the next build, however, one is not sure when that would be available. So, if one is using dual apps, then think twice. I still need to carry my old phone as dual app is not working. Also, OnePlus care(support) has no clue about extended warranty. Paid for extended warranty, 4 days have passed since then but one plus support has no clue. Photo access from gallery is very slow. If one is having hundreds of photos in gallery then pictures take time to load when scrolling through them. Even my previous 2 year old phone fared way better. Software optimization is lacking.","02 Aug 2021","Colour: Gray Sierra Size name: 12GB RAM+256GB Storage","","Yes","Amazon Customer","1.0","OnePlus Nord 2 5G (Gray Sierra, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Sierra-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B097RDVDL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"My experience after 14 days","I am writing this review after using this Mobile from Last 14days. I know the confusion of a person who is going to spend Big amount of money on mobile. I gone through the same phase and I willl try to give my honest review about OnePlus nord 2 and cover all the aspects of it. I will make sure that after reading this review you will easily make your decision. 1) Camera rear camera : 5/5 front camera : 4/5 Awesome Rear camera with 50MP main perform super. I have attached images for reference. Focus is very fast and dynamic range is also Plus point. front camera is also good buy note best but I can say that over-all it's good in this price range. So many users are complaining about colour os code merge into oxygen os but I feel that camera quality is improved due to this. camera features are well organized compare to only oxygen os. 2) software experience : 5/5 It's awesome experience for me as I am coming from MIUI ( redmi note 4 ). Clean UI without any bloatware and ads. 3) Performance : 5/5 All applications are working very smoothly. I never encounter any lagging issues till now.  I didn't play havey games on it so I am not aware about gaming performance. over-all I can say ""Phone makkhan ki tarah chalta hy"". 4) charging time : 5/5 super fast charging. 5) Face recognition Speed : 5/5 it's very very fast similar to charging Speed. 6) Fingerprint sensor Speed : 4/5 7) Battery Life : 4/5 It's give you 6-7 hours screen on time which is  good. For me Full charging Last for 1.5 days. 8) Carrier Aggregation and network quality : 5/5 9) Look  : 5/5 when you hold it on your hands it's look very primium Mobile. I have grey colour which comes with Matt finish. 10) Ram management : 3/5 This is bit disappointing part in OnePlus nord 2. I think this will improve after software update so no need to worry. 11) Heating issue Yes Mobile is heating bit when you use continuesoly for long time. But this is classical OnePlus issue and It can be solve through software update. 12) Haptic feedback : 5/5 13) Display : 5/5 14) speaker : 5/5 dual speakers with High loudness makes is awesome 😎 conclusion : If you are normal user and looking for well balance Phone in all aspects then OnePlus nord 2 made for  you in this price range. Just buy it and please don't forget to Thank me later 🙂","28 Aug 2021","Colour: Gray Sierra Size name: 8GB RAM+128GB Storage","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/914uS1c-nqL._SY88.jpg

"NORD 2- The flagship killer! Smooth as butter.","The media could not be loaded. TL;DR: Classy look and feel, 12GB version is smooth as butter, the pictures are detailed and true to life, Charges to 90% in just 30minutes with its 65w Dash Charger, No 3.5 mm headphone jack, free basic phone case in box. 👉🏽 Received it today within a day of ordering the phone. So, this is the initial first look impression. Plus I've added my experience of using it for a week. This is what I liked- 1) Transition to the new phone was super easy thanks to the One Plus ""Clone Phone"" app. 2) The on-screen finger print sensor and the face recognition works like a flash! 3) Great haptic feedback, whether you type, use gestures, notifications you can feel it well and it's a great user experience. 2) The 90Hz refresh rate and the 12GB RAM makes the phone ultra smooth, transitions are seamless. The OnePlus launcher is pretty intuitive and gesture controls are cool. 3) I wish there was the option to disable or uninstall few inbuilt (bloatware) apps like Google Messages, Play Movies etc. directly from phone's app manager. However, you can enable developer mode and then uninstall those apps manually by connecting your phone to the laptop and then via adb commands. 4) The Grey model is having matte finish while the Blue Haze has glossy finish. While both the phones are very good in terms of grip and are not fingerprint magnets. 5) The main camera is too good, you get really true to life detailed pictures, portraits are professional, macros are great as well. Need to check how it performs in low light. I've added two photos (of new shoot of pine plant & Building facade), not sure if they would be uploaded in high quality or not, however, the detailing is superb. 6) Battery performance seems well optimized and the dash charger charges the battery from 0% to 90% in less than 30 minutes. Really Impressive charging speed🔋. My phone has lasted for approx 1 day 23 hours with singe charge &light usage. With heavy use like watching couple of hours of movies+ calls+ social media on screen time -- it lasted about 12-13 hours. 7) Those of you who use Google Play books to read epubs, it's gonna be a great experience to read the books in ""eye comfort"" mode for longer duration. 8) The free phone case that's provided is pretty decent, it's got raised ridges for the camera and the screen so you can use it until you get cases of your choices available in the market. Plus the grip is good. 9) I really find the slider useful to switch between 'Silent', 'Vibration', 'Ring'. Really thoughtfully made. What could have been better? 1) It's always good to give people the power to make decisions. OnePlus could have kept the easy to use 3.5mm headphone jack, it's not a big deal for me but it adds convenience and the need to not have another extra device to keep track of and charge regularly. Plus, frequently using the charging port for inserting the adapter for USB-c to 3.5mm earphone jack could be problematic. Also, you can't fast charge and listen to audio in that case. Using a Bluetooth earphone is fine, but 3.5mm jack is still the most practical audio interface because: Ease of use, longevity, convenience. (It's a con for me, I've got BT earphones still love wired earphones for sound quality, ease of use) 2) There isn't any secure folder (Samsung users would know the benefit of it) 3) The OnePlus Gallery app is fine, however you can't add rich text with customization in the edit mode to your images on phone. 4) The Battery! Could have provided a 6000mAh battery, too much to ask for? No- Samsung is providing it. However, thanks to the super-fast fast charging (within 30-40 mins) you won't feel this much. Remember to keep your dash charger safe!","28 Jul 2021","Colour: Blue Haze Size name: 12GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZL+q+jB1L._SY88.jpg

"NOT up to the mark","I was excited to get the One plus Nord2 5G phone in hand. I was a user of One plus one earlier and then moved to Redmi k20 Pro. and then again back to One+1 nord 2. But got disappointed with the performance of the new phone from oneplus. I used to get better battery backup and good camera interface in Redmi K20 pro even after 2 years of use. The oxygen OS getting mixed with color OS is pathetic. Lots of lag in applications.  Especially the one I got irritated is the Auto rotate option. I enabled Auto rotate for  watching you tube and all videos, but after a phone call , I noticed the dialer gets rotated but will not turn to normal screen even after keeping the phone straight , I have to restart the phone to get the dialer straight from rotated. Another issue noted is the camera focus, when we try to scan the bar code on whatsapp web, it takes time to capture or read the barcode , even when we try to take close shots pictures, i see the camera is not able to focus fast and stays blurred for a long time, then we have to adjust our self to get the clear picture. Over all the phone is light weight, and easy to handle. I did not feel heat up, unless i enabled hotspot for laptop connection. Being an earlier one plus user, I hope OnePlus come up with updates to solve these issue faced by users.","02 Aug 2021","Colour: Blue Haze Size name: 8GB RAM+128GB Storage","","Yes","Amazon Customer","3.0","OnePlus Nord 2 5G (Gray Sierra, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Sierra-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B097RDVDL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"It's premium! Best phone under 30k nord is direct answer!! One bad is it asks many permissions","I bought this as gift for my father!! Will share my First impressions. Pros: - In hand feel is premium felt like using samsung s series. - Display top notch for the price 👌 with 90hz. - Practically oneplus made good camera phone under this price point. - This is a perfect 5g phone has all bands. - still oxygen os is main layer and feels like oxygen os - build quality is strong. As hardware good device. Cons : - kinda oppofication code base destroys oneplus UI experience. - asks many kinda permissions while setting up device. Like for camera app asks call permissions. Unwanted permissions. Overall its good phone for the price. It's start phase of oppo-fication!! Please oneplus stay as oxygen os don't turn into something else.

Please take back this phone & refund the amount or provide a better replacement in the same price range. Update 15/08 - Overall performance is ok now, however in close shots rear camera struggles. Update 27/08 - I still feel it's not worth buying.

"Great Handy Phone For the Price.","First Impressions- will update detailed review The phone is solid, feels good in hand, small size, can be used single handedly, the back glass does not attract fingerprint. I have the haze blue variant. It's a glossy finish. Some YouTubers say that the gray has a matt finish, so you can check Display: Display is crisp. The brightness levels are good for indoor and outdoor usage. Doesn't get as bright as OnePlus 9 series, but decent enough. There is little blue tint that you notice when you tilt the screen Don't know if it's common. Speakers: Speakers are decently loud. I thought it would be low, but I liked the sound output. Call quality is also decent. During calls , No issues in hearing the other person, earpiece are also decently loud. I won't say it's the most clear I have heard. Overall you won't ve disappointed with the sound output, it can go decently loud. Software: Oxygen OS is smooth, doesn't come with a lot of bloatware, although u may have to be cautious of some permissions like that in search bar and there are some built in Oxygen OS Apps. Can be easliy avoided. There are a few bugs, like the vibration motor intensity change is not working well on my phone. I will report the same in the community Camera: Main camera is really good. can take night shots as well with adequate details. Performs really well indoors and outdoor. Wide angle camera is below average. The details are not good. It can only be used to put some pics on social media. I am considering it a single camera device. So a better deal compared to Pixel 4a (because 4a has become an year old). 2 mp mono camera- I doubt if it even works Charging- Battery life is decent, can easliy last one full day. Charging speeds are good, if the atmosphere is cool. I tested the 65W charger, charges the phone fully in around 45 mins, although I am not going to use it daily, because fast charging takes a toll on the battery life. So charging with a 20W charger, even with that charges decently fast. Performance: Haven't done gaming yet, will update the review after that. But general performance is very good. No glitches, apps are wroking pretty smoothly. Doesn't heat up in normal usage. Update after 15 days of use- Initially the battery drains fast, but it's normal for a new phone. Post 3-4 complete recharge cycles, the battery is now performing as per expectations. The main camera quality is really good, can even take some really crisp night light photos. Gaming performance is smooth for casual gamers. The phone doesn't get heat up that much. It remains within limits. Definitely not a full fledged gaming phone. The software experience is very good, that's something which lacks in a lot of android phones. The UI and transitions are very smooth, no visible lags, and the best part is it's single hand usability. Overall it's a great phone for power users and professionals. Definitely not the most feature rich or on-paper powerful, but it ticks most of the boxes. AFTER 3 MONTHS A lot of bugs.....screecast and bluetooth doesn't work well","28 Jul 2021","Colour: Blue Haze Size name: 8GB RAM+128GB Storage","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81aVG6qI24L._SY88.jpg","Yes","Josh","5.0","OnePlus Nord 2 5G (Gray Sierra, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Sierra-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B097RDVDL2?pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Not really a flagship killer, but certainly checks ""most"" boxes","Launched at 12AM, ordered at 12:03AM :P This is my primary and only phone now, and after two days of usage, well... - Body: Feels good. Really. They have perfected the edges and feels solid to hold, does not feel flimsy, if only they reduced the camera bump a little. - Screen: The 90Hz AMOLED is love at first sight. <3 The colour reproduction, the viewing angles, the scrolls, they are just amazing. - Battery: Lasts me more than a day, and charging is a breeze, takes less around 20 minutes to reach from 10% to 100%. Does get a little warm with continuous screen time, but not worrisome standards. - UI: The haptics and the tiny animations they put in are extremely thought out, like a tiny circling dot around the front camera when in use, and ability to change the fingerprint animations, etc. My first OnePlus, don't judge me if these are new to me. - This is my first in-display fingerprint phone, and I am not sure if its just mine, or in general, but coming from a solid physical fingerprint scanner, I feel this scanner misses a few hits, you really need to know the exact area, etc. Not a deal breaker. The animations and haptics compensate. - Camera: High hopes. Normal daylight shots are fine, but ""ultra-wide"" is disappointing. Night ultra wide goes haywire. Portraits are okay, good skin tones, but bokeh feels out of place. Heavy image processing, feels artificial. The camera UI isn't ergonomic and feels out of place for OnePlus. No Macro. - Software: Day 2 and software update for Oxygen OS. - No Memory card, lack of expandable storage :x - No headphone jack :( Let's see what happens. 12 days after: Received two OTA updates, not much camera changes as company claims, but Wifi connection becomes seamless. Camera: My my still so weird. 4k 60fps N/A. ""Ultra crisp portraits"" becomes inactive in 'portrait' mode, only works in regular photo mode. 50mp inactive for Night mode. Front camera still average, they desperately add extra white. HDR looks too artificial.

"Too low battery life🔋","After 2 weeks of use here is my review. Pros: 1. Look & feel. 2. Rear camera & photo quality. 3. Fast charging. 100%🔋 in 30mins. 4. Fingerprint sensor. Cons: 1. Worst battery life. 2. 5 hrs screen on time only. I've used only one 4G sim. If I've used both sim slots guess the battery backup. Oh sorry this is 5G smartphone. Wait for 1-2 hour screen on time when 5G come. My 3.5 years old mobile Realme 1 (3410 mAh) has batter 🔋 life than this so called flagship oh sorry Oppo smartphone  with ColorOS😅.

"Killer smartphone with good camera and performance under 35k","The media could not be loaded. After 21 days of use.. let me tell you that I am literally impressed with the phone. why because i was supposed to buy vivo v21 and then cancelled the order and thought about buying oppo reno6 pro and then finalized on oneplus nord2 which was one of the best decisions I took for investing in a 35k smartphone. I saw many negative reviews where users were complaining about oneplus brand saying its not good as its predecessors..but this nord 2 is a real game changer.. Here are some of my findings and reviews I have to share with you guys, images taken in different lighting conditions: Image 1 and 2: unboxing Image 3: back camera portrait mode at indoor light Image 4: video pro mode with bokeh feature at outdoor daylight Image 5: selfie camera at portrait mode Image 6: back camera portrait mode Image 7: night mode with minimal light Image 8: back camera normal mode with natural daylight Image 9: back camera at portrait bokeh mode with shop front light. After testing the camera quality in different light conditions, I found pictures coming in natural colors and tone. . Pros: 1. Excellent back camera with good detailings 2. Premium look and display 3. Warp charging of 10-15 mins for full charge. 4. Buttery soft performance with so much of customization and features. 5. decent battery life unless you are not a gamer. but still has a good backup up to one and a half day even after using 6-7 hrs continuously. Cons: 1. Front camera not as good as back unless there is good ambience lighting. 2. Battery might drain if you are a hardcore gamer, but still lasts for one day. . Overall as it says: Oneplus nord2 has everything that you are looking for..","28 Aug 2021","Colour: Blue Haze Size name: 12GB RAM+256GB Storage","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A13IbSG7eqL._SY88.jpg

"Solid build, amazing camera , good battery backup, superb gaming performance, ultra smooth display","What's not to love about this phone, i was a OnePlus 6 user since May 2018 and the phone was running fine but I just bought this phone on impulse by just seeing the specs and the price point.....and i am glad OnePlus didn't disappoint. Ordered it on 26th July and received it today , been using this phone for 3 hours and i am just loving it. People are comparing this phone with Poco F3 GT but let me tell u guys that the UI experience u will get with MIUI is nowhere close to Oxygen OS, not to mention better cameras. I am glad OnePlus is back to the flagship killer segment and not just flagships. No overheating issues as of now....and everything is on point.

"Pros and cons as per my usage","Excellent flagship mobile. Pros and cons as per my usage Pros: 1) Main advantage of this mobile is its camera.Able to get natural colour most of time and this time one plus changed their front camera and 32 MP camera is good for  selfies.One plus worked on camera a lot. 2) Another Pro is 65w charger which charge my mobile from 0 to 100% in 30 min. 3) Design wise it's looking like mini one plus 9 and also they gave Corning gorilla glass protection both front and back. 4) UI is pretty smooth to use and processor is also bit fast. Cons: 1) 90 Hz is good but still 120 Hz is better in this price range. 2) There are many pre installed apps and some are not removable. 3) Getting ads sometimes. 4) Not very much friendly for gamers as facing slight hanging issue in bgmi Apart from this overall performance is good and camera is best in class.Design is elegant.Resale value for one plus is good compared to other android smartphones. If you are not a gamer and need mobile for photography and professional use blindly go for this.","28 Jul 2021","Colour: Blue Haze Size name: 8GB RAM+128GB Storage","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1OVitz5ECS._SY88.jpg","Yes","sreedharan","5.0","OnePlus Nord 2 5G (Gray Sierra, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Sierra-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B097RDVDL2?pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"OnePlus nailed it this time","OnePlus has done a great work with this phone. It is more robust as well as good looking than the previous Nord. Yes, the software is a bit different. Someone even pointed out that the apps are asking for unnecessary permissions, but personally I don't feel that is a security flaw (MI and IQOO does that too) About the product: 1. The Grey Sierra version has frosted gorilla glass on the back that resists fingerprints. 2. The screen is bright enough to be visible in bright sunlight (no need for those 1200 nits bright panels) 3. Plastic body but has a premium look beware of scratches. Even if the gorilla glass is resistant the body isn't. 4. The camera OIS works like a charm when taking night mode photos, slowmo videos, normal videos and zoom shots. 5. Camera quality is better than the previous Nord but not as good as flagship phones. This camera can definitely give you Instagram ready shots (with a bit practice) 6. The best part is the charging speed. Gets the battery from 10-90 in 20mins. Plug in when you go for a shower and it's fully charged when you come back. The battery will definitely last for more than a day with normal use. If you game for 3 hours a day then you would need to charge it at least twice but the charging speed definitely solves this problem. Summing up: I was sceptical while buying this phone because people usually would complain about how bad their OnePlus phones are on Instagram comments as well as reviews on Amazon but in the end this phone is definitely worth it. It also has more than five 5G bands making it future ready. I have added some sample shots. If you liked the review then vote this as helpful.","29 Jul 2021","Colour: Gray Sierra Size name: 8GB RAM+128GB Storage","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1LnEkCUAfL._SY88.jpg

"Worth 👍","If You are Looking for Overall Performance Phone with best in class processor , camera , clean UI and battery life with premium feel in hand. Go blindly with this OnePlus Nord 2. I personally feel OnePlus is somehow more reputed brand than others mid range phones. So invest your hard earn money in good brand. Update:- Using this from 8 days now , got 2 updates and everything is working buttery smooth 👌👍 Camera is just awesome , and battery is top notch I am getting 7-8 hour's of SOT easily with 2 hrs of gaming. Fast charging is getting faster update by update , now my phone is changing in 28 min from 0 to 100%. No heating issue till now. Definitely will recommend this device for professional and classy type people who is not focused on fancy triggers and rbg lighting. Just invest in this phone and you will be relax for 2-3 years atleast.","28 Jul 2021","Colour: Gray Sierra Size name: 8GB RAM+128GB Storage","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+EQwEcZ3L._SY88.jpg

"Average smartphone with a lot more heating issues","I received nord 2 on 29 August after using for 6 days this is my review. -The phone is average in all its aspects such as average camera quality majorly front camera(not getting clear image some blurring is there). -Charging is fast in 20 min 100% but it causes a lot of heating issues I fear after reading the news of oneplus nord 2 blast. As the phone heats in normal usage also. -Asks for so many permissions and hampers the security. -Apps are working fine and smooth. -Fingerprint scanner and qr scanning takes sometime not that fast. -I exchanged my realme 2 pro with this and now I can't return this phone @AMAZON is not giving refund option. As a PRIME member first bad experience with amazon. -My 3year old phone worked better then this one. And people and company saying explosion happened due to external factors so I guess we are not allowed to carry oneplus nord 2 in our pockets it might cause some external issue.🙂 -Lastly I think I should have waited for Google pixel 5a instead of buying this phone.

"Complete waste of money.","Pathetic phone. I am cursing myself why I bought it by spending my hard earned money. I was really excited to own One plus phone as all previous one plus phones have good reviews. Here are few of the major problems: 1. Battery is getting drained out super fast. Within half a day's normal usage, phone's battery is dying. No videos, movies ir any heavy use just normal calls, Google meet d camera usage takes the battery from 100 to 25% 2. Most annoying is messages are not displaying sim number. How can I know whether a message is received in sim 1 or 2? Called oneplus they too are not aware of this issue as it's a new phone. They said write your feedback on our community forum. Technical team will try to solve this issue in next update. 3. Message classification not available. Notification, push msg, promotion msgs and personal important msgs all are clubbed together without any classification. 4. If you want to record any call for safety purpose, it is playing a loud message for the other side to hear... Your call is now being recorded. Safety wise, if anyone is calling me, threatening me, I can't even record them as it warns them. I have raised battery issue with Amazon and they have issued  a technician visit this week.

Oneplus mentioned phones were blasted due to external factor - don't know what could be external factors, those factors are applicable to realme, samsung, iPhone too but haven't heard such a news from other brand. Hope OnePlus does something good for customer about this phone rather than just sending legal notice to the people who complained for blasting.

"Just hype nothing else","It seems that OnePlus has lost mind.. 1. Camera Quality:  it's the super worst in all the cases, specially front and ultra wide cameras are most worst performer.. front seems to be 5mp instead of 32mp.. super disappointment.. main shooter is also performing just ok.. main 50mp is capable to perform more but OnePlus algorithms mess up here.. 2. Performance: Diamensity 1200 is more capable but OnePlus again lowered the performance by using their extra idiot mindset... 3. Screen Quality: it's just ok, not that much superb.. 600 nits max brightness with average chin size.. common OnePlus it's 2021.. 4. Battery Life: battery performance is also just ok but I think after the updates this issue will be resolved (Hope so).. charging speed is mind blowing.. 5. Rest all things are good as considered the price.. 30k tag.. if you consider 35k high storage nord 2 then it's seriously not worth it in any case.. 6. Software Experience: I will say it's completely color OS under the OnePlus skin.. No good experience with this twin UI.. shame shame OnePlus..
