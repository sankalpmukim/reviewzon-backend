Android 11 with One UI 3.1 is clean and very responsive and runs smooth without stutter or lag. One can avoid ads and bloatware if you setup the device carefully.

In this budget, this is possibly one of the best offerings. In the world of Android,nowadays Samsung possibly has the best offerings in every price range. Camera is OK enough. At least OK for a 10k phone. Sound quality is loud and clear, with display of good quality. Ganes and consumption of multimedia is enjoyable.Interface is clean and multitasking is smooth. Charging is fast enough. Obviously, the best part is it's massive battery and power usage. With moderate use, it can easily go past 2 days and that is a big plus for people always on the go. In the 10-11k category, this is possibly the best I've used so far. This is a phone for ages to keep. Thanks to Amazon, delivery was in perfect condition. P.S. Before buying, even I was skeptical reading some of the negative reviews. I'm a common user, and my understanding is if you're expecting top of the line performance from a budget phone, then your expectations are to be blamed. Or most of the bad reviews are sponsored ones. If you want top of the line, you gotta spend top of the line. This phone gets the BASICS right, and that is what matters in the long run. And no phone in this category will offer a truly top class camera; even if they do,they will compromise in some other areas. Whereas, M12 with its 8nm efficient structure along with a Trusted Chip Set gets the job done in a smooth manner. Overall, if you want Smooth operations with Reliability, trust Samsung M12.","","Timeless Budget Warrior !","","https://www.amazon.in/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHUPCVYPSUCVHXMCAMVDYF5CDFAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B08XGDN3TZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Samsung","https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R7R1T7SZHXM75/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08XGDN3TZ","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-M12-Storage-Processor/dp/B08XGDN3TZ?smid=A1EWEIV3F4B24B&pf_rd_r=JD94BDXMQRFZTZK1QFWC&pf_rd_p=62887b7a-8c70-40cb-8190-cd9b8621ddbd&pd_rd_r=821178bb-4534-44e4-9943-8fc4c8caebab&pd_rd_w=Y57Oo&pd_rd_wg=t1viE&ref_=pd_gw_unk"

My use case is: office related video calls, email, WhatsApp, online shopping, connecting to chrome cast and watching YouTube videos on tv, sms, phone calls, reading kindle books, etc. Screen ON time, about an hour or so a day depending on video call duration. I do not play games on my phone. I keep it on battery saving mode, and 60hz screen refresh. Been using the phone for more than a month now. Very satisfied with the performance. Only slight issue was the slightly heavier weight of the phone compared to my previous phone. But I have gotten used to it and it does not bother me at all now. Regarding the screen being non fullHD, I thought it would be something I would notice. Nope, I feel no difference when reading books on kindle. Maybe teenagers with better eyesight will notice, but I definitely cannot. In summary, I‚Äôm very happy with the purchase.

Good Performance (I use a lot of apps in multitasking but I don't play games so can't review gaming performance). 5. Supports 15WT fast charging. 6. Display is good according to the price range. (Don't get confused on poor display reviews.) 7. Side positioned fingerprint sensor is good. (In starting you can face problems if you are currently using a back fingerprint sensor) 8. Low light image from the back camera is also good. One attached in the image. 9. Currently(11/04/21- 15/04/21) this phone is available @11700 (effective price)using Indusind bank cards so it is a loot deal for now. (Lowest ever price for this phone) Cons: 1. Very bad front selfie camera which is 8MP (If you are a selfie addict then avoid it) 2. Phone is very heavy and big in size. 3. Adaptive brightness is not up to the mark. 4.Animations are a little bit slow. 5. Contact searching speed in the contacts app is very slow.(Resloved after update) 6. After every update they install MX Takatak, Moz like apps which you can uninstall anytime. ( I think to make this phone that much affordable they are trying few methods of Mi and other Chinese brands.) Result: Best phone with all the latest features in this price range. @ 11700 - 12500 Important(For those reviews who are saying the phone is slow): Got to developer options(Search Google for how to enable it ) and then Set Windows Animation Scale to .5x, Transition Animation Scale to .5x, Animator Duration to .5x. (Earlier all 3 developer options are set to 1x that's why the phone seems a little bit slow).

Samsung doesn't even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone. The settings screen automatically come on home screen randomly on any other thing that is playing. Its camera is less than mediocre. Sound quality is bad. Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices.

The smartphone display comes with a 90Hz refresh rate. Samsung Galaxy M12 is the only smartphone in this price range to come with this high refresh rate. Samsung Galaxy M12 comes with an adaptive refresh rate which means that the panel cannot be locked at a high refresh rate. The high refresh rate display functioned smoothly during scrolling through Facebook and Instagram. For some reason, the refresh rate on the Samsung Galaxy M12 is locked at 60Hz for the notification centre. Also, the 90Hz mode is turned off while using apps like YouTube. Despite the high refresh rate and HD+ resolution, the display on Samsung Galaxy M12 is not that sharp and vibrant. The brightness is also not great and you might face some struggle while using the smartphone under direct sunlight. The display is large enough for you to enjoy movies and also play games. The display also comes with an eye comfort shield which reduces the blue light from the screen and prevents eye strain. The display on the Samsung Galaxy M12 is decent but it is definitely not the selling point of the handset.","","Awesome phone","","https://www.amazon.in/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHVH242HGO2QL2Y7SMN2C5LKLWVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B08XGDN3TZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Samsung","https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RNDJSRNUAT3R4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08XGDN3TZ","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-M12-Storage-Processor/dp/B08XGDN3TZ?smid=A1EWEIV3F4B24B&pf_rd_r=JD94BDXMQRFZTZK1QFWC&pf_rd_p=62887b7a-8c70-40cb-8190-cd9b8621ddbd&pd_rd_r=821178bb-4534-44e4-9943-8fc4c8caebab&pd_rd_w=Y57Oo&pd_rd_wg=t1viE&ref_=pd_gw_unk"

It never happened with any of the phones I have used so far (more than 10 phones ) . Some of them were really cheap too. I don't know why this phone makes the eyes hurt. I am not a particular fan of Eye Comfort Shield feature so this is a big minus point for me. - Camera here truly is just an accessory. Well, anyway, I didn't buy this phone for cameras, my expectations were already low but the quality of pics are even lower than what I expected. - Screen resolution.

You even get headphone jack. 5. The screen is pretty big best for online classes and binge watching. 6. I have played games like BGMI, CODM, NFS with ease. My final opinion is that you should buy this phone if you want to do online classes, play games, or if you want a phone with big battery or if you are a binge watcher.

Also, the cameras are decent, the front camera is ok in low light or in some cases indoor lighting, but the front camera is pretty good! I have seen phones with these exact same features for double the price! The screen is respectable it's not pixely, but it's not the best ofc. The screen is pretty smooth, its 90hz is really nice and smooth. Gaming on this phone is ok. I mean like I told you the battery can last you a long time, and the same thing applies to gaming now ofc the battery will run out faster but not significantly faster. Playing the actual game its self is decent only the VERY high-powered games is a bit laggy on this phone but most of the games work smoothly.

Now, Samsung realise that selling their name is no more working and reduce the price at the level of other company to success in the market . I bought 6 gb one and very happy with it now. However, as before, many of the inbuild apps irritating me which are not uninstallable. After using it for 3 months plus, let me give my fair opinion: 1. Battery life makes me happy, but fast charging needs 2 hrs plus is little bit annoying. 2. Camera must not be more than 12 Megapixel. As compared to my previous phone MI Note 6 pro, I dont see any better snap here. 3. Finger print sensor is absolutely annoying. Most time i have to enter my password manually as FP sensor do not detect my fingerprint. How my previous phone MI Note 6 pro nicely detects my fingerprint and easily open phone has been missing here. 4. As MAH is more, thr weight of phone is bit heavy. I dont know why Silicon cover of around Rs 99 approx cannot be attached here in the package!! I bought silicon cover from Amazon but lately arrived which cause my phone screeen crack due to fallen from my bed. If it was in Silicon cover, the Lcd must have been intact till now. MI 6 Pro had come with one extra phone safety cover but Samsung cannot. 5. After two years , I come to Samsung again hoping much UI improvement. However, i found Samsung do not compete with even MI in certain ways. I need to put Alarm clock on, i can easily go directly to all clock setting by clicking wall paper clock in MI while this phone need me to go to the clock in menu and so.

So these are my first impressions after initial setup Size: This is a huge phone. So if you have small hands this phone cannot be used single handed. If you need to use it single handed often, better go for a grippy case with a string or a ring case so it doesn't fall out. Or go for a small phone Speed: It is a bit slow, but you can get used to it. For the price range, it seems to have a decent performance. Audio: This phone is advertised as supporting Dolby Atmos but that's only for bluetooth or other audio devices. Not for the phone speaker. Which is kind of a shame. But the audio is not bad. Video/Screen: Blacks are not exactly black. But again, for this price you shouldn't notice those things. Colors are bright ***The phone is country locked. So to activate any other country sim you must first use an Indian sim for 5 mins cumulatively. I have not tested the other features like camera, fingerprint sensor etc. Will update as soon as I do","","Good budget phone","1","https://www.amazon.in/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AENWG6YNPLJET6PK72PFMZ62ESXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B08XGDN3TZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Samsung","https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R29SPL70IHOYP5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08XGDN3TZ","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-M12-Storage-Processor/dp/B08XGDN3TZ?smid=A1EWEIV3F4B24B&pf_rd_r=JD94BDXMQRFZTZK1QFWC&pf_rd_p=62887b7a-8c70-40cb-8190-cd9b8621ddbd&pd_rd_r=821178bb-4534-44e4-9943-8fc4c8caebab&pd_rd_w=Y57Oo&pd_rd_wg=t1viE&ref_=pd_gw_unk"

Good battery, 1.5 days backup approx Overall satisfied.","","NOT bad,","","https://www.amazon.in/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGZCGDEEOVPT5FHZ6RGKQ5XEZI7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B08XGDN3TZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=24&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Samsung","https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3FH4RYRRL7UMZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08XGDN3TZ","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-M12-Storage-Processor/dp/B08XGDN3TZ?smid=A1EWEIV3F4B24B&pf_rd_r=JD94BDXMQRFZTZK1QFWC&pf_rd_p=62887b7a-8c70-40cb-8190-cd9b8621ddbd&pd_rd_r=821178bb-4534-44e4-9943-8fc4c8caebab&pd_rd_w=Y57Oo&pd_rd_wg=t1viE&ref_=pd_gw_unk"

I'm a student and I generally use laptop for much of my work and uses mobile very little, so can't give that much detailed review about everything but yeah I can say one thing that if you are a student than it will definitely serve the purpose for which you will buy it.","","A good option to consider in this price range","","https://www.amazon.in/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHVXI45VWIZMXLRR7SRTS2G5ICBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B08XGDN3TZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=15&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Samsung","https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RJBO99BEVHGSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08XGDN3TZ","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-M12-Storage-Processor/dp/B08XGDN3TZ?smid=A1EWEIV3F4B24B&pf_rd_r=JD94BDXMQRFZTZK1QFWC&pf_rd_p=62887b7a-8c70-40cb-8190-cd9b8621ddbd&pd_rd_r=821178bb-4534-44e4-9943-8fc4c8caebab&pd_rd_w=Y57Oo&pd_rd_wg=t1viE&ref_=pd_gw_unk"

Rest time will tell. But so far everything is just perfect. Was not aware that it had face recognition and finger print read. Though the phone is not that sleek and on the bulkier side, but I think that makes it even more durable and solid. And Rs. 1000/- off on ICICI credit card was icing on cake. Forget other brands. Need not say anything else. Totally impressed. Bought another one in black for my daughter and she too is in awe, even though she was using an IPhone 6 S. And it has been mentioned on the box, that it is manufactured in India. Another plus point. One can go for it with eyes closed, if budget is around Rs. 10k approx. If one is ok and satisfied with the features offered.

Go for the 6GB/128GB variant as some of the RAM and STORAGE is already occupied by the system. The display is good for viewing too... not too bad. PROS I FOUND AFTER MY USER EXPERIENCE: 1) Android 11 out of the box, ONE UI CORE 3.1 is awesome and simplistic. 2) It has DOLBY ATMOS for headphones which definitely gives a difference. 3) The weight and thickness is AVERAGE and you won't even notice anything. 4) Fingerprint Scanner is working well and good. 5) Some of the Motion and Gestures settings are really cool and useful. 6) The HIGHLIGHT of this phone is the Battery, and for me it lasted completely for 3 days straight on normal calls and some youtube. The charging time is worth it for the battery duration. This phone will get updates till android 13 or 14, which is great. The Exynos 850 8nm Processor is working well in terms of speed and smoothness. The 90Hz Refresh Rate is great and I felt the difference in smooth animations.

I am a frequent traveller and caller so was looking for a budgetary phone which has most of the features along with good battery backup. This meets my requirement. Pros: - Fit and finish is very good - Good battery backup - Performance is good with fast response - Storage and ram is sufficient as I opted for 6 GB RAM and 128 GB storage variant - Responsive finger printing sensor - Loud and clear sound with and without speaker for calls - Clear voice calling Cons: - Heavy weight makes it difficult to hold and use - The screen is HD only. Not even FHD but supports 1080 p video viewing - 4 K videos will never play in 4 K mode. Only can be played in 1080 p resolution - No gyroscope and magnetometer sensor which means, compass application and some games which use these sensors will never work - No Corning Gorilla class. Screen is prone to scratches without cover - Sound is below average for music listeners - Double tap doesn‚Äôt work to wake up the screen Conclusion: Only go for this if you are using for phone calls with good battery backup. Not worth for entertainment purpose. I can still survive on this as I have an iPad for entertainment. Samsung is marketing it in such a way where none of the sensors specifications and entertainment features are mentioned clearly on the website as it is not having any of them.

Initial opinion is full value for money for those who are looking for descent phone with a very good battery life.","","It seems Samsung has delivered what they have been promoting in Galaxy M12","","https://www.amazon.in/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHEGCGZ5GFQF236JIIHBMZE25IXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B08XGDN3TZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Samsung","https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R221LAHJUM6MOJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08XGDN3TZ","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-M12-Storage-Processor/dp/B08XGDN3TZ?smid=A1EWEIV3F4B24B&pf_rd_r=JD94BDXMQRFZTZK1QFWC&pf_rd_p=62887b7a-8c70-40cb-8190-cd9b8621ddbd&pd_rd_r=821178bb-4534-44e4-9943-8fc4c8caebab&pd_rd_w=Y57Oo&pd_rd_wg=t1viE&ref_=pd_gw_unk"

And fast charging 15w A negative portion is weight, its weight is about 221 gm it's heavier i noted this here because, samsung introduced m21 model with more specifications and perfomance carrying the same monster typical battery 6000 mah but weighing only around188gm is very lite weight and easy to handle (remember the prize difference).Overall my conclusion is the product is worth for money.

For first two days it worked ok. (OK because this phone is very slow) BUT on third day, 12th May 2021, it was hanged very badly. It was neither getting switched off nor restarted..!! Immediately I have contacted the customer care for its solution. The Amazon representative has responded well and helped me to book technician's visit, which has completed on 15th May 2021. Amazon is ready for its replacement according to their 7 days replacement policy and hand to hand replacement. It was a traumatic condition for me as I have bought this phone in this COVID pandemic in very urgent condition and I badly need a phone always working 24X7 as my family was admitted in the hospital. Also, people who wish to buy it for its Camera then please beware as Samsung is advertising it as TRUE 48MP QUAD CAMERA but its result is like 8MP blurred one. Second thing is the phone is very slow and its UI is frequently NOT WORKING. Third thing is its speakers are giving old radio kind of noise. Luckily, there is no option for rating it ZERO or NEGATIVE star, else I would definitely give that rating to this product. There is ""No Return Available"" and only replacement option is given by Amazon. Only positive thing in this entire incident is that I have bought through Amazon and got their prompt support. I am very much thankful of Amazon as they have replaced this faulty device with new one on 16th May 2021, means within one day after technician visit. Now, I am only hoping that replaced SAMSUNG M12 mobile may perform to atleast ""OK"" level, if not to ""GOOD or BETTER"" standard.

There are so many difficulties I'm facing since then. It's honestly not been a good experience so far. 2nd slot of the sim doesn't work most of the time, so can't make requent outgoing calls from the same. Every now and then, I've to Turn Off & On the Sim2 slot, then only it works fine. Also camera quality is pathetic. One major problem is with the fingerprint sensor. For 1st 10 days, it was working superb, but now the fingerprint sensor mostly fails in recognising & opening the phone. Also, sometime my phone lags while working on multiple apps.

There is no fingerprint sensor on the back with Samsung choosing instead to integrate it with the power button.good to see Samsung using a USB Type-C port for its affordable devices, and that is present at the bottom alongside the 3.5mm headphone jack and speaker grille. he display on the Galaxy M12 is a 6.5-inch HD+ (720 x 1,600) TFT panel that has a 90Hz adaptive refresh rate. In its price range, the Galaxy M12 appears to be the only phone with a high refresh rate. the display is a standard panel with healthy peak brightness, controlled saturation levels, and minimal colour shift when viewed at an angle. A quad-camera system is present on the Galaxy M12 which comprises a 48MP primary sensor with an f/2.0 aperture, a 5MP secondary ultra-wide lens with a massive 123-degree field of view, a 2MP depth, and a 2MP macro sensor. As far as budget phones go, the Galaxy M12 does a decent job of capturing details At night, the camera is a bit inconsistent and a slight shake can induce blurriness in the shots. I keep my expectations about low-light photography in check from a lot of budget phones, but the M12 is above average and good. Lastly, you get a beefy 6,000mAh battery that is very likely going to last you two days on moderate usage.","","Samsung M12","","https://www.amazon.in/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG4GI7VPJA5S5VRTD6RF6NWTI64A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B08XGDN3TZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Samsung","https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RI8ST6730C1YQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08XGDN3TZ","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-M12-Storage-Processor/dp/B08XGDN3TZ?smid=A1EWEIV3F4B24B&pf_rd_r=JD94BDXMQRFZTZK1QFWC&pf_rd_p=62887b7a-8c70-40cb-8190-cd9b8621ddbd&pd_rd_r=821178bb-4534-44e4-9943-8fc4c8caebab&pd_rd_w=Y57Oo&pd_rd_wg=t1viE&ref_=pd_gw_unk"

I just love the side mounted fingerprint and power button but may be difficult for some new smartphone users 4.camera though not great, at this price point it stands stronger than its competitors with all four cameras 5.colour variants of phone can be even more optional for users (as of now only three courses two usual colors and one slightly different colors. 6.speaker is usual loud but not so great since it's competitors atleast gives surround speakers at this price point. But clarity of sound is great,but bass lovers wouldn't love these speakers. 7.Actually the expectation and reality of Samsung exynos processor changed my opinion on their processor...it was great üëç...u will definitely love it... 8. One UI stands apart from all its competitors(especially mi ui ads on mi phones) It was my own experience and review with the phone...

Storage is plenty with Expandability. Form factor I found good Too. Cons: Performance; sometimes it lags and the 90hzs is a gimmick, the UI itself is too laggy to notice it's smoothness. They went wrong in cameras too, just because they can afford to put a 48 megapixel camera doesn't mean it's good. The ISP is bad and makes even the bayered photos look noisy. I would suggest to use a GCam mod, then again I didn't find one that works perfectly for Exynos 850. Also other 3 cameras are just as bad if not worse. Shooting raw helps if you have the time to edit it later on Lightroom or snapseed. Also Noticed that the software adds background blur that looks unnatural, at f2.0 this should not happen at all.

It has good battery backup, the display, even though 720p is not bad to look at, screen brightness is optimum. RAM management is good for day to day apps. Haven't found any lags. Haven't tried playing any games on it. The battery last for 2 days on normal usage and 1 day on heavy usage and takes about 3hrs to fully charge. Over all it is a great phone. The true monster. Update: After using it for nearly 6 months I'm facing proximity sensor issue, which I found is common in midrange samsung devices because of which I'm planning to change the phone and never am I going for another Samsung device. There are minor stutters here and there even while using light apps like YouTube.

But, I've not seen anyone talking about sound quality. Maybe their handsets are working absolutely fine.. Maybe my particular handset is troublesome. Anyways, since I got the phone on my hand, I couldn't explore as much as I should but overall my experience with Samsung is not up to the mark. I purchased Samsung's phone hoping to get some amazing performance which the company and other reviewers (mainly YouTube reviewers) claim. I am not that technically sound person to digest every single term the phone companies (manufacturers) use these days. Still, I've gathered a little bit of knowledge and experience after using various smartphones over the long 11-12 years. I got this model (Galaxy M12) exchanged with Redmi 8A Dual which was not that much worse.. The sound was pretty loud be it media sound, ringtones, call sound, etc. Frankly speaking, I've not checked gaming, camera and other features the way I did with sound quality. I'd recommend experience yourself before you buy this phone if at all possible.","","Audio Output Too Low","","https://www.amazon.in/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE5SYNDQDBJHXB7IBKFFXKDHQ5SA","https://www.amazon.in/product-reviews/B08XGDN3TZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=21&filterByStar=all_stars&sortBy=helpful&reviewerType=all_reviews","Samsung","https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3MA76JVSZ7D6I?ASIN=B08XGDN3TZ","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-M12-Storage-Processor/dp/B08XGDN3TZ?smid=A1EWEIV3F4B24B&pf_rd_r=JD94BDXMQRFZTZK1QFWC&pf_rd_p=62887b7a-8c70-40cb-8190-cd9b8621ddbd&pd_rd_r=821178bb-4534-44e4-9943-8fc4c8caebab&pd_rd_w=Y57Oo&pd_rd_wg=t1viE&ref_=pd_gw_unk"
